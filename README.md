# Cycle.js Community

This organization is a place for Cycle.js drivers and modules authored by the community.

The official [cyclejs](https://github.com/cyclejs) organization contains the code for Cycle.js itself and the core libraries developers might use. (HTTP, DOM, etc).

This organization exists to host all of the projects that we want to work on as a community that aren't related to core Cycle.js functionality.
