# Cycle.js Community

This organization is a place for any Cycle.js project that welcomes collaboration. We welcome all types of projects, from drivers to games to documentation to art.

The official [cyclejs](https://github.com/cyclejs) organization contains the code for Cycle.js itself and the core libraries developers might use. (HTTP, DOM, etc). We're here for all of the cool stuff the community makes.

About our community
---

We are a welcoming, collaborative community. We believe that contributions should be encouraged and celebrated. We especially welcome those who feel like they might not be welcome, or able to help. Come one, come all.

We do not tolerate behaviour that makes other contributors feel harassed or unwelcome. Please see the **[code of conduct](https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cyclejs-community/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)**.

In short, don't be a dick and consider how others will perceive your actions. If you experience any negative interactions, please contact either @tylors or @widdershin and we will do our best to help. If in doubt, get in touch.

Getting involved
---

We welcome contributors of all levels of experience and from all different backgrounds.

We are liberal about membership. If you want to be a member, please open an issue on this repository and we will add you. :smile:

The most straightforward way to contribute to a repository is to open a pull request. We ask that repositories in our community follow [Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as using pull requests allows for more review, discussion and learning to take place.

When one of your pull requests is merged, you will be added as a collaborator to the repository. This allows for easier collaboration (as collaborators can work together on pull requests).

Being a collaborator means:
  * You can push to the repo, and to branches.
  * With the permission of the other collaborators, you can merge pull requests.
  * You get to have a say in the development of the project.
  * You have no obligation to contribute, but any work you do is very appreciated.
  * You still work with pull requests, but now you work on the repo itself, not your fork. This makes it easier to collaborate.
